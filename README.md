# DataSciProject_SS2021
A project I did for my data science class in the Summer '21. The project's titel was "Interest Based Location Recommendation System using FourSquare Data".
### Data
I was using a well-formatted Table of Data, with the columns "user_id", "venue_id", "venue_category_id", "venue_category_name", "latitude", "longitude", "tmz_offset", "utc_time". The Data can be found in the project3_data.txt file.
## Tasks
- For any given userID and venue_category_name, recommend the user 5 new locations that are of similiar category to the one that was specified.
- For any given userID, find 10 users who are similiar to the specified user.
- For a given set of 5 userIDs and their randomly selected locations from data, recommend a place where these 5 peoplecan meet. The recommended place must be relatively close to each one of the 5 userIDs.
